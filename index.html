        <h2>About Aneudy</h2>
        <p>
          I started learning web development back in 2s017 and have been
          enjoying the process of creating a web page ever since. My experience
          as a student at <strong>Thinkful </strong> has been great thus far.
          <strong>Thinkful </strong>
          comprises a great community of fellow developers that are always
          willing to help. As a sports fan, I enjoy spending time with my family
          watching a game or playing with peers in my spare time.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have always been intrigued by the world of computers and how they
          work. if you are looking to hire a new developer or have an idea that
          you would like to bring to life please contact me. Iâ€™m thrilled to
          work with other developers to bring ideas to life
