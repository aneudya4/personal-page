            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I started learning web development back in 2017 and have been
              enjoying the process of creating web pages ever since. My
              experience as a student at <strong>Thinkful </strong> has been
              great thus far.
              <strong>Thinkful </strong>
              comprises a great community of fellow developers that are always
              willing to help. As a sports fan, I enjoy spending time with my
              family watching a game or playing with peers in my spare time.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have always been intrigued by the world of computers and how
              they work. if you are looking to hire a new developer or have an
              idea that you would like to bring to life please contact me. Iâ€™m
              thrilled to work with other developers to bring ideas to life.
